                    <h3>History of the Establishment of the Dungun District Museum</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea of establishing the Dungun District Museum was inspired by the launch of the East Coast Economic Region (ECER) by Malaysia's Prime Minister on October 28, 2007. The initiative emphasized promoting coastal tourism, islands, culture, and heritage. The Terengganu State Museum Board proposed to the State Government the establishment of a museum in Dungun due to its global renown for iron ore mining activities in Bukit Besi since the 1930s. The 'soft opening' ceremony of the Dungun District Museum took place on August 19, 2008.

                    <h3>History of the Dungun District Officer's House</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Dungun District Officer's House was built in 1941, measuring 24.5 meters in length and 6.63 meters in width. The house, which now appears worn, is made of wood with a cement tile roof. It once served as the temporary residence of the British Assistant Adviser. The District Officers of Dungun who lived here included Tuan Haji Dol Abdullah bin Alias (1941-1942), Che Khalid bin Kassim (1943-1945), Haji Khalid bin Awang (1974-1975), and many others.

            <h3>History of the Establishment of the Kemaman District Museum</h3>
            <p>
                The establishment of the Kemaman District Museum, which focuses on prominent individuals from Terengganu, was planned and initiated by the Kemaman District Museum Development Committee and was approved in a meeting of the Terengganu State Museum Board.
                <br>
                Given that Terengganu has produced many successful figures in various fields, both nationally and internationally, the establishment of the "Muzium Jasa Mu Dikenang" (Museum of Your Services Remembered) is deemed necessary to honor and provide proper recognition to these individuals.
                <br>
                The individuals featured in this museum are among the many successful people from Terengganu in their respective fields, including politics, administration, sports, culture, religion, literature, and education.
                <br>
                It is hoped that this museum, which showcases the contributions, sacrifices, and struggles of these distinguished figures, will provide valuable information, especially to the new generation, inspiring them to emulate and strive for success, thereby bringing honor to the state and the nation.

            <h3>Early History of the Malayan Banking Building</h3>
            <p>
                The Kemaman District Museum building was constructed in the 1920s. The architecture of this single-storey concrete building is a blend of English and Islamic architectural styles, resulting in a Moorish-inspired design. It is located in the heart of the town, occupying an area of 0.2 acres at Lot 132, Jalan Sulaimani, Chukai, Kemaman. The building once served as the office for the manager of The Nanyo Kogyo Koshi Companyâ€™s iron ore mining operations in Macang Setahun, Kemaman.
                <br>
                The building later became the property of Malayan Banking Berhad and functioned as a bank. In 2008, the building was purchased by the Terengganu State Government from the Kemaman Municipal Council and handed over to the Terengganu State Museum on March 5, 2009, to be developed into a district museum, thus becoming a new tourist destination in the southernmost district of Terengganu, Kemaman.
                <br>
                On October 15, 2009, conservation work on the building was carried out by two companies appointed by the Kemaman District Public Works Department.
